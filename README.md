# Object_Detection_Using_OpenCV-_and_YOLO

 Developed an Object detection Model for recognition, and localization based on the YOLO algorithm and OpenCV.Perform YOLO object detection using Deep Learning, OpenCV, and Python.Applied the YOLO object detector to video streams
•	Library used : OpenCV,Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib
•	IDE used :Jupyter Notebook
•	Darknet open source neural network framework is used in this ,which allows  to make computations on a GPU, which is essential for real-time predictions
